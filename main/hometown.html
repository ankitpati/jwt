            My hometown is famous for several amazing natural features.&nbsp;
            <strong>First</strong>, it is noted for the Wheaton River, which is
            very wide and beautiful. On either side of <strong>this
            river</strong>, which is 175 feet wide, are many willow trees which
            have long branches that can move gracefully in the wind.&nbsp; In
            autumn the leaves of <strong>these</strong> trees fall and cover the
            riverbanks like golden snow.&nbsp; <strong>Second</strong>, on the
            other side of the town is Wheaton Hill, which is unusual because it
            is very steep.&nbsp; Even though it is steep, climbing
            <strong>this</strong> hill is not dangerous, because there are some
            firm rocks along the sides that can be used as stairs.&nbsp; There
            are no trees around <strong>this</strong> hill, so it stands clearly
            against the sky and can be seen from many miles away.&nbsp;
            <strong>The third amazing feature</strong> is the Big Old Tree. This
            tree stands two hundred feet tall and is probably about six hundred
            years old.&nbsp; <strong>These three landmarks</strong> are truly
            amazing and make my hometown a famous place.
